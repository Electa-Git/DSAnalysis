%
% DSA_mat2toeplitz is a function at the core of the frequency-lifting
% method: it provides the block-Toeplitz form of a matrix based on its set
% of matrix Fourier coefficients.
%
% M is a 3D matrix, and it corresponds to any of A, B, C or D in a
% state-space representation.
% The first and second dimensions of the matrix are related to the system
% dimensions, i.e. numbers of inputs and/or outputs and/or states.
% The 3rd dimension of 3D matrix M is the harmonic dimension:
% 
% The 3D matrices can be seen as stacks of harmonic layers. There are
% 2*h_m+1 layers. The first operation is to take the layers and make a 
% series out of them. The series of layers is stored in a cell. Each 
% element of the cell named M_series is therefore a matrix.
% 
% Due to the mapping between series and matrix configurations, M_series 
% actually has 4*h_t+1 elements.
% 
% IMPORTANT:
% If h_t >= h_m, then the 4*h_t+1 elements are obtained from the 2*h_m+1
% elements of M, and extra spaces are filled with zero matrices.
% If h_t < h_m, there are two possibilities:
%       - strict_truncation == 1 will make that extra elements in M will be
%         ignored, and replaced by zero matrices
%       - strict_truncation == 0 will keep the extra elements in M, and
%         also fill remaining space with zero matrices

function new_HD = DSA_HD_init_from_source(old_HD, new_HD, varnames, new_h_m)
%% new_HD = DSA_HD_init_from_source(old_HD, new_HD, varnames, new_h_m)
% 
% This function writes the harmonic content of variables in varnames from 
% old_HD to new_HD while taking into account the fact that the two  
% structures might have different h_m values.
% 
% Only the variables in varnames are overwritten. The other variables
% in new_HD are left unchanged. old_HD is not changed whatsoever.

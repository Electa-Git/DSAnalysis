% 
% Implementation of the DFT - Discrete Fourier Transform
% The function takes time-domain waveform x_TD as input. Its corresponding
% sampling frequency must be specified as f_s. The maximum harmonic index
% up to which the Fourier coefficients are of interest (i.e. the requested
% maximum harmonic rank) is given in h_max.
%
% This function relies on DSA_DFT and automates the calculation for
% structures.

function DSA = DSA_get_HSS(DSA)
%% DSA = DSA_get_HSS(DSA)
%
% Function DSA_get_HSS fills the DSA structure with field LTI (see DSA.LTI
% afterwards. This field contains the LTI system representation. Generally,
% this system corresponds to a frequency-lifted system, since it is the
% main purpose of this toolbox to deliver such systems. However, it is also
% possible to work with non-lifted LTI systems, by simply setting parameter
% h_t (the truncation rank) to zero. Please refer to the PhD thesis of the
% author to understand how to choose the truncation rank, as well as its
% relation to the periodic rank and the forced periodic rank.
% 
% This function is essentially a dispatch function, which calls either 
% DSA_LTP2HSS(DSA) or DSA_LTP2DHSS(DSA) according to whether the system has
% pure delays or not.

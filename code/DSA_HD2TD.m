function x = DSA_HD2TD(X, t, f_1)
%% x = DSA_HD2TD(X, t, f_1)
%
% This function implements the numerical evaluation of a Fourier series.
% More specifically, it transforms Fourier coefficients into a time-domain
% waveform based on the provided time vector and fundamental frequency:
%     t must be a column vector or a scalar [s]
%     X must be a column vector of Fourier coefficients (from - to + freqs)
%     f_1 is the fundamental frequency [Hz]

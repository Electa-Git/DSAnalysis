function output = DSA_dxdt_lasi_delay(t, x, X_dly, DSA)
%% output = DSA_dxdt_lasi_delay(t, x, X_dly, DSA)
%
% This function returns the dxdt vector of DDEs for dde23.
% The presence of multiple time delays is handled automatically.
% This function is also used to retrieve output values over complete time
% spans once the numerical integration is finished.
%
% When integrating DDEs via dde23:
% x is a column vector. This column corresponds to a time t, rows
% correspond to the state variables.
% X_dly is a matrix. Columns correspond to t-T_d1, t-T_d2, etc. Rows
% correspond to the state-variables.
% 
% When extracting data, x is a matrix. The time dimension is along the 
% second dimension, so the columns correspond to different time steps.
% X_dly is a 3D matrix. Columns are still according to the various values
% of delays, while the time dimension is now along the third dimension.

% handling delays:

% The calculation of the states derivatives at time t involves quantities
% that depend on delayed variables, i.e. on states and inputs as they were
% at previous time steps, e.g. at time t-Td.
% For this reason, this dxdt function first enters a loop where variables
% can be calculated as they were at previous time steps.
% While delayed states are provided by dde23 in X_dly, the delayed inputs
% must be retrieved from uOft manually.
% At the end of each passage in this loop, delayed variables are stored.

% delayed variables are being calculated but are not known yet:
for idx = 1:DSA.info.D
    delayed.(DSA.vars.lasi_delayed{idx}) = [];
end

% determining the necessary calculations, where delays equal to zero are
% evaluated last:

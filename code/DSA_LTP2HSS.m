 function [TA, TB, TC, TD, TN] = DSA_LTP2HSS(DSA)
%% [TA, TB, TC, TD, TN] = DSA_LTP2HSS(DSA)
%
% This function transforms the LTP system matrices A, B, C, D into their
% corresponsing Toeplitz matrices, as defined by the HSS theory.
%
% The input matrices are 3D, the third dimension being the harmonic
% dimension. Their depth is equal to 2*h_m+1.
% 
% The resulting Toeplitz are defined up to truncation rank h_t.
% The forced periodic rank h_f is also taken into account for the lifting.

%
% Implementation of the DFT - Discrete Fourier Transform
% The function takes time-domain waveform x_TD as input. Its corresponding
% sampling frequency must be specified as f_s. The maximum harmonic index
% up to which the Fourier coefficients are of interest (i.e. the requested
% maximum harmonic rank) is given in h_max.
%
% The function returns the vector of Fourier coefficients in x_HD, as well
% as the vector of corresponding frequencies in f and the value of the base
% frequency f_b.
